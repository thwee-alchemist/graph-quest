See the [game](https://graph-quest.herokuapp.com) in action. Graph Quest is a simple, abstract space conquering game. After entering your name and creating a game, you start with a randomly colored cube. After clicking ready to start the game (you can wait for other players to join), select your cube and a neighboring cube and issue an order for the star's ships to set out to conquer the neighboring star. Your goal is to conquer all the stars as the map is revealed to you. 

Be warned, right now, the NPC stars don't attack, but they will grow their fleet strength with each turn - as do your stars - and attempt to defend against any attack. A balancing issue makes it so that it's currently possible not to win the game on your own.
